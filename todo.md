-> signUp click -
data should be store in state and also in database.
change the userLogin to true.

2. make new component inside home for login user

3. - Allow users to add new tasks.
   - Display a list of all tasks.
   - Provide the option to update and delete tasks.

today I worked on:

- signup and login component
- redux toolkit for state management

problems:
clicking on sign/login makes rerender home component

future changes:

1. make changes in handleChange -> for switchCase so that it will only run when click on submit.
